Mojave "Vanilla" Installation
=============================

USB Installer:
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Rally --nointeraction --downloadassets

Generate a random number with Clover Configurator and check it on Apple's Coverage Check website:
https://checkcoverage.apple.com/us/en/?sn=GENERATEDSERIAL

The following AML files were required for Mojave to work properly:

SSDT-GIGE.aml  = Realtek LAN and Broadcom WLAN controller support with device and properties injection
SSDT-HDEF.aml  = AppleALC support with injected layout ID (alternatively in Clover set boot arguments as "alcid=1")
SSDT-OTHER.aml = Provision of ACPI names to IORegistry for various non-recognised devices (aesthetic reasons)
SSDT-SATA.aml  = Vanilla support for compatible Intel Corporation 9 Series Chipset SATA Controller
SSDT-UIAC.aml  = USB ports enumeration/patching for Intel Corporation 9 Series Chipset USB EHCI/XHCI Controllers
SSDT-USB.aml   = EHCI and XHCI Controller properties and device injection for improved USB operation (e.g. power options)
SSDT-XOSI.aml  = Improved USB behaviour by adding further Windows versions for ACPI implementation

Now through Clover patching, most of device compatibility is defined in the config.plist for (IGPU) (HDEF) and (SATA)
except a couple of AML files that are left enabled: SSDT-OTHER.aml and SSDT-XOSI.aml


Minimal Clover UEFI Drivers (x64)
=================================

ApfsDriverLoader.efi = Recognize and boot from APFS volumes by loading apfs.efi from ApfsContainer located on block device.
AptioMemoryFix.efi   = Needed for Afps driver and includes NVRAM fixes, as well as better memory management.
DataHubDxe.efi       = DataHub protocol and mandatory for macOS.
EmuVariableUefi.efi  = Support for NVRAM variables needed by macOS if hardware NVRAM is not supported.
FSInject.efi         = Driver responsible for Clover kext injection into kernel cache.
SMCHelper.efi        = Restore SMC keys left in NVRAM by FakeSMC (not compatible with VirtualSMC.efi)
VBoxHfs.efi          = Open source EFI file-system driver for HFS+ file system.

Abandoned/Replaced:
OsxAptioFix3Drv.efi  = Alternate driver (v3) to fix memory problems on EFI firmware, do not use in parallel with AptioMemoryFix.

N.B. The MLB variable in "Rt Variables" of Clover must include the same as "Board Serial Number" (13+4 digits) in SMBIOS.


Basic MacOS Kernel Extensions
=============================

The following drivers are required for Mojave to work properly:

Patcher       = Lilu.kext
Audio         = AppleALC.kext
Graphics      = WhateverGreen.kext
Ethernet      = RealtekRTL8111.kext
Wireless LAN  = AirportBrcmFixup.kext
Bluetooth     = BrcmPatchRAM2.kext with BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext (in /L/E/ only)
BT Continuity = BT4LEContinuityFixup.kext
SMC           = FakeSMC.kext (by Slice)
CPU Monitor   = IntelCPUMonitor.kext (by Slice)
H/W Monitor   = HWMonitorSMC2.app (by Slice)
USB Ports Fix = USBInjectAll.kext (obsolete due to kextless USBPorts.kext)
